### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge is to get familiarized with the data. The best way to overcome it, was to go over the data and understand each column of the transaction. The second challenge was to figure out the format for the date columns. As it was explained on the modules, it needed to be converted. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater has the highest amount of successful outcomes when they launch in May.

December is not a great month to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The lower the goal the more percentage of success on the campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The date of the dataset needed to be converted from epoch to a date format. Additionally, the category and the subcategories needed to be splitted.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could have create a table or graph for Outcome based on country, also we could have analize average donation based on outcome
